# smart-auto-tracking-fan

## Project Description

Fans are a common household appliance, and have not improved significantly in recent years. To add more novel function to the fan, we have incorporated a thermal camera and motors to ensure that the airflow is always directed at the user. This surpasses the functionality of a simple oscillating fan, which always moves through the same motions. Lastly, through the integration of variable wind speed we can always ensure maximum user comfortability.
